 ## Music Stream App

This is a music streaming app built using React.js and the React Router library. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and listen to music.

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/AbhiGupta8295/playful-client
cd music-stream-app
npm install
```

### Running the App

To run the app, simply run the following command:

```
npm start
```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Code Overview

The app consists of the following components:

* `App.js`: This is the main component of the app. It sets up the routing for the app and provides the context for the authentication token.
* `About.jsx`: This component displays information about the app.
* `SignupForm.jsx`: This component allows users to sign up for an account.
* `Login.jsx`: This component allows users to log in to their account.
* `Main.jsx`: This component is the main page of the app. It displays a list of all the songs in the database.
* `AllSongs.jsx`: This component displays a list of all the songs in the database.
* `Reset.jsx`: This component allows users to reset their password.

### Authentication

The app uses a authentication system based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). When a user signs up or logs in, they are issued a JWT that is stored in local storage. This JWT is then used to authenticate the user's requests to the server.

### Routing

The app uses the React Router library to manage routing. The routes are defined in the `App.js` component.

### Conclusion

This is a simple music streaming app that demonstrates the use of React.js, React Router, and JWTs. The app can be easily extended to add more features, such as the ability to create playlists, add songs to a queue, and share songs with other users.
